<h2>Vision Board Redefined.</h2>

Karmik is our first React project that boasts full CRUD functionality and incorporates all of the MERN-stack technologies. 

You may have heard from time to time that the best way to achieve your goals is to make a plan,  envision it, manifest it and work hard towards it. Vision boards are a powerful tool that gives users the ability to narrow down their intentions and goals for themselves in life. 

This is why we have created Karmik, a digital answer to the traditional Vision Board. Karmik allows users to create multiple boards online for different goals in life that they can update and delete at any time in their profile. They can also view their boards anywhere on any device.
